# Each player has 4 hole cards. The board will form a 3x3 square, and players can make a final hand with any of their
#     two hole cards plus any 3 cards on the board that forms a straight line, vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
# On the flop the 4 corners of the board will be dealt, and on the turn, the 4 sides, with the river being the center  card alone.
